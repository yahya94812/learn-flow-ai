<i> Discover LearnFlow AI — the smart learning companion that turns any study material or any concepts into an interactive, personalized learning experience with flashcards, quizzes, and your own AI tutor. </i>
------------------------------------------------------------

### **Core Workflow**

1. **Input Phase**
    
    * Student **uploads study material** (PDF, DOCX, PPT, etc.) or **enters topics manually**.
        
    * AI **analyzes** and extracts key learning concepts.
        
    * If no material is uploaded, it **curates content** automatically from trusted sources.
        
2. **Study Plan Generation**
    
    * AI **reorders or introduces subtopics** for logical learning flow (from fundamentals → advanced).
        
    * Creates **step-by-step learning path** with subtopics divided into “learning steps”.
        
3. **Flashcard Learning Mode**
    
    * Each subtopic shown as a **colorful, animated flashcard** (content < 100 words).
        
    * Includes **text + audio narration** for better engagement and accessibility.
        
    * Supports **visuals (diagrams/images)** where relevant.
        
4. **Micro-Exercises**
    
    * After **every 3 subtopics**, AI generates a **short exercise**:
        
        * Objective (MCQ)
            
        * One-word answer
            
        * Match the following
            
    * Exercises can combine **concepts from current and previous subtopics** to reinforce learning.
        
5. **Topic-End Quiz**
    
    * Mixed question types:
        
        * Objective
            
        * One-word
            
        * Match the following
            
        * Long-answer or explanation-based
            
    * Tests **comprehension and recall** across the full topic.
        
6. **Performance Analysis & Revision**
    
    * After the final test:
        
        * AI identifies **weak areas**.
            
        * Generates a **personalized revision plan**:
            
            * Flashcards for weak subtopics
                
            * Targeted quizzes for reinforcement
                
7. **Tutor Bot Interaction**
    
    * Students can **chat with a tutor bot** anytime:
        
        * Ask doubts
            
        * Get explanations, hints, or examples
            
        * Receive clarifications using context-aware responses
            
8. **Progress Tracking & Motivation**
    
    * Dashboard shows:
        
        * Learning progress per topic
            
        * Quiz scores and improvement trends
            
    * Motivational system:
        
        * **Rewards, badges, and milestones**
            
        * **Encouraging messages** upon completion
